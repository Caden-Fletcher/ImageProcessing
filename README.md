My personal project for manipulating images, for fun and practice.

Currently the program allows the user to:

Open Image Files (.bmp, .gif, .jpeg/.jpg, .png)
Save Files
Decrease/Increase Brightness of an Image
Get the Grayscale of an Image
Get the Negative of an Image
Flip an Image Horizontally/Vertically
Rotate an Image +90° / -90°
Export the frames of a .gif animation
