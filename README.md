My personal project for manipulating images, for fun and practice.

Currently the program allows the user to:

- Open Files (.bmp, .gif, .jpeg/.jpg, .png)
- Save Files (.bmp, .gif, .jpeg/.jpg, .png)
- Decrease/Increase Brightness of an Image
- Get the Grayscale of an Image
- Get the Negative of an Image
- Flip an Image Horizontally/Vertically
- Rotate an Image +90° / -90°
- Export the frames of a .gif animation
